# Features and Requirements

## This is the life cycle of a user on this app for a three person group with the goal to workout 3 days a week:

1. User creates account.
8. Add friends by username.
9. Create group.
10. Choose a habit. A good example is to go for a run 3 days a week. A bad example is run 1 mile three days a week. It shouldn't need to be quantified, only specific enough that can be verified from a simple photo. qualitative > quantitative.
11. Set minimum frequency of check-in (i.e. work out 3 days a week).
12. Invite friends to join.
13. At the start of every period (i.e. week), given a library of plants to choose from (will auto-pick if not chosen). plants are standard and take minimum frequency (i.e. 3 users * 3 days = 9 total check-ins for the week), while accessories to the garden may take a multiplier of more check-ins (i.e. 3 users * 3 days + 3 extra = 12 total check-ins for the week).
14. Users take a picture of their workout (not from camera roll) at their discretion three times on separate days of the week.
15. Users must endorse it as valid, can also upvote and comment.
16. Every time a user's check-in is endorsed as valid by everyone, the plant or accessory grows or progresses respectively.
17. If users do not collectively reach the required number of check-ins, the plant that was growing dies.
18. Repeat from step 9.
