# Introduction

A collaborative habit-building app that leverages social accountability to help users establish and maintain positive routines. Users join groups centered around specific habits—such as cleaning, going to the library to study, or exercising—and participate in check-ins that require evidence of their progress in the form of photos (like BeReal). Group members validate each other's check-ins, creating a supportive community that fosters commitment and consistency. If users cumulatively miss the required number of check ins, not only does the streak visibly reset but a beautiful unique plant that was once growing is uprooted and reset (like Forest), adding a gentle layer of peer accountability. To motivate ongoing participation, consistent users earn badges and unlock new plants. By combining habit tracking with peer validation, this idea transforms personal goal-setting into a shared journey, enhancing motivation through collective encouragement and accountability.
